# Flutter Riverpod – Minimal State Management Integration (2024)

This repository contains a **minimal and functional integration of Riverpod** into Flutter’s default counter app.

It serves as an educational template for understanding how to set up and use Riverpod with code generation using `build_runner`.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To demonstrate how to refactor Flutter's default counter app to use **Riverpod's latest approach**, including annotations, code generation, and clean folder structure.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies used

- Flutter 3.x
- Dart.
- Riverpod 2.6  
- Riverpod Annotation.  
- Riverpod Generator.
- build_runner.

---

## 🚀 Getting started

1. Install the **riverpod dependencies** in the **pubspec.yaml** (take into account the version at the time of installation).

~~~
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8
  flutter_riverpod: ^2.6.1 -> this
  riverpod_annotation: ^2.6.1 -> this

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^4.0.0
  build_runner: -> this
  custom_lint: -> this
  riverpod_generator: ^2.6.1 -> this
  riverpod_lint: ^2.6.1 -> this
~~~

**Important:** After adding the dependencies and updating the **pubspec.yaml**, either with **ctrl+s** or **flutter pub get**, run the command **dart run build_runner watch** so that the providers code can be autogenerated (Example -> part 'count_provider.g.dart';).

2. Wrap the **MyApp()** in **ProviderScope()** in **main.dart**.

~~~
void main() {
  runApp(const ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));
}
~~~

3. Create the **providers folder** and inside it create the **provider** that shares the state. 

~~~
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';

//Mandatory for create the provider generated code.
part 'count_provider.g.dart';

//With this @riverpod decorator, it is inferred that a provider will be created.
@riverpod
class CountNotifier extends _$CountNotifier {
  //initial value.
  @override
  int build() => 0;

  //methods to update the state.
  void increment() => state++;
}
~~~

4. Create the **shared folder** and inside it create the **widget** that consumes the **provider**.

~~~
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_test/providers/count_provider.dart';

//Change StatelessWidget for ConsumerWidget - Widget that consumes the provider.
class ButtonStateText extends ConsumerWidget {
  const ButtonStateText({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final count = ref.watch(
        countNotifierProvider); //returns the value of the provider's state variable.
    return Text('$count');
  }
}
~~~

5. Change the **StatefulWidget** to **ConsumerStatefulWidget** and **ConsumerState** in the class that uses the **shared widget** **(homepage.dart)**.

~~~
//Change StatefulWidget for ConsumerStateWidget.
class MyHomePage extends ConsumerStatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({super.key, required this.title});

  final String title;

  @override
  ConsumerState<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}
~~~

6. Change the method that increments the value of state to the increment method of the **provider** we have created. 

~~~
floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: ref
            .read(countNotifierProvider.notifier)
            .increment, //read the (notifier) provider for use the methods for update state.
        tooltip: 'Increment',
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      )
~~~

7. Changes the basic text widget **(Text)** to the widget that receives the updated status value **(ButtonStateText)**.  

~~~
Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          children: <Widget>[
            Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            ButtonStateText() //Custom Widget
          ],
        )
~~~
